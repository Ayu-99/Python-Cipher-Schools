"""
#1
You are given a 0-indexed string s and a 0-indexed integer array spaces that describes the indices in the original string where spaces will be added. Each space should be inserted before the character at the given index.

For example, given s = "EnjoyYourCoffee" and spaces = [5, 9], we place spaces before 'Y' and 'C', which are at indices 5 and 9 respectively. Thus, we obtain "Enjoy Your Coffee".
Return the modified string after the spaces have been added.


#2
You are given a 0-indexed integer array nums and a target element target.

A target index is an index i such that nums[i] == target.

Return a list of the target indices of nums after sorting nums in non-decreasing order. If there are no target indices, return an empty list. The returned list must be sorted in increasing order.

Input: nums = [1,2,5,2,3], target = 2
Output: [1,2]
Explanation: After sorting, nums is [1,2,2,3,5].
The indices where nums[i] == 2 are 1 and 2.
