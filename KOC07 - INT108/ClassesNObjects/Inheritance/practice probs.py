PRACTICE:

1. Create a class Student with two instance attributes student_name and student_marks. Create two member functions
a. print - to print the information of student (name and marks)
b. passOrFail - based on the marks, check whether student is pass or fail (pass if marks are greater than 33)

2. Create two derived class A and B inheriting from a base class C, then A class itself is base class for class D.

3. Create a class named Shape with function that prints "This is a shape"
Create another class named Polygon inheriting the Shape class with function that prints "Polygon is a shape"
Create two other classes Rectangle and Triangle inheriting from Polygon class having functions that say
"Rectangle is a polygon" and "Triangle is a polygon"
